## Recommended Folder Structure

```bash
.
├── public
├── src
│   ├── app
│   ├── components
│        ├── ui
│           ├── button.tsx
│           ├── input.tsx
│        ├── rhf-components
│           ├── rhf-input.tsx
│   ├── hooks

```

### Public

The public folder is used to store static files like images, fonts, etc. These files can be accessed directly from the browser.

### Src

The src folder is the main folder where all the code of the project is stored.

#### App

The app folder is used to store the main app component. This component is the entry point of the app in next.js. Incase of a different framework, this may vary but the main component should be stored in src with other folders like pages according to your preference.

#### Components

The components folder is used to store all the components of the project. The components are divided into two folders ui and rhf-components.

- #### ui

  The ui folder is used to store all the shadcn UI components. These components are built using the shadcn design system and can be used in your project.

- #### rhf-components

  The rhf-components folder is used to store all the react-hook-form components. These components are built using the react-hook-form library and can be used in your project.

### Hooks

The hooks folder is used to store all the custom hooks of the project. These hooks can be used to share logic between components.

### Lib

The lib folder is used to store all the utility functions of the project. These functions can be used to perform common tasks like formatting dates, etc.

### Types
